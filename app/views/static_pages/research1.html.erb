  <h1>Research Interests</h1>
  <p>I am working mostly in metaphysics, but have interests in the philosophies of logic, language and the mind, in epistemology, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of perception and the philosophy of law.

  <p>In case you are interested in my CV, <%= link_to 'here it is', 'cv.pdf', download: '' %>.

  <p>At the moment, I am pursuing the following research projects, in no particular order (details and outputs below). Drafts are password-protected -- please ask me or guess (it's obvious...):
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fundamentally, there are no relations</b>. I argue that fundamentally/really/in fact, there are no relations. Aristotle, the medievals and Leibniz were right and Russell was wrong. There is structure, however, and
    <li><b>Qua Qua Qua</b>. Qua objects, if only they could be made sense of, would be the real philosophers' paradise. Some proposals have been made, but the very rich treasury of historical antecedents has not yet been tapped into. This long.term project aims to develop, making full use of the history of philosophy, a systematic theory of qua objects (roles, aspects, cooky objects, accidental unities) and make a case for them by showing their theoretical usefulness across a wide range of traditional philosophical problems.
    <li><b>How to Prove Your Existence in Three Simple Steps</b>. This grew out of my book on Descartes, a German-style rationalist reconstruction of the first three <i>Meditations</i> that itself grew out of my MA thesis. Over the years, it has put on some weight: it now includes (arguments for) controversial claims regarding the distinction between the analytic and the synthetic method
      material falsity of ideas,
    <li><b>An Ontology of Perspectives</b>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Fundamentally, there are no relations</b>. Is relationality a fundamental feature of reality? Are relations reducible to monadic properties? I argue that these two questions are different, that the answer to both is "no", and that there is no tension between these two claims. Even though relational predications are indispensable, for both logical and metaphysical reasons, their truthmakers are structural, not relational facts. Relations – qualitative entities that have a direction and order their particulars – are not, and cannot be, fundamental. At the fundamental level of reality we do not find relations, but pure, irreducible and nonrelational structure. Russell’s famous arguments in the <i>Principles</i> do indeed rule out what he calls ‘monadism’ (the claim that every relational predication is equivalent to predications of only monadic predicates), but they fall short of refuting 'monism’: relational predications may be made true by monadic properties of wholes – and indeed are, if there are no fundamental relations. <br>
      On the way to this conclusion, I examine different recent conceptions of relations, and argue that they all succumb to what I call the 'problem of converses'. The problem of converses arises from the fact that any account of relations according to which there are, or might be, non-symmetric relations, allows for what I call an ‘abstractionist’ definition of converse relations. Such converses then give rise to problems of ontological profligacy, metaphysical indeterminacy and infinite regress. Friends of relations have to accept that the facts of the cat being on the mat and of the mat being beneath the cat are different, that it is indeterminate which one is more fundamental and that the difference between the relations being on top of and being under cannot be spelled out in a non-circular way and has to be accepted as ‘brute’ – a package of claims which I take to be a reductio of the assumption that there are fundamental relations. <br>
      Aristotle, the medievals, Leibniz and Spinoza were thus right, the modern orthodoxy is wrong: relations are not what explains how the world forms an inter-connected whole, but are on the contrary viewpoint-relative and perspectival abstractions from a prior structure. To many, such a conclusion will appear unbelievably ‘retro’: did not the Cambridge revolt against idealism rest on the case that modern logic showed the indis- pensability of relations? To assuage such worries, I take a closer look on the debate that is usually taken to have conclusively shown the need for relations: the famous exchange between Russell and the British Ideal- ists at the beginning of the last century. A proper understanding of the promise and the demise of Russell’s multiple relation theory of judgment, I argue, shows that Bradley was right: how relations relate can be understood only if they are seen as arising from, and being grounded in, metaphysically prior structure. It does not show that Russell was wrong, however: his theory can indeed be salvaged if couched in structuralist, not relational terms.
    <li><b>How Things Are</b>, a very extensively expanded (and substantially revised) version of my thesis, in seven parts (of which (parts of) the first three comprised my thesis);
      <ul>
        <li>Determination -- a defense and generalisation of Fine's critique of modal accounts of essence, including an argument for non-modal and contingent concepts of essence and supervenience;
        <li>A Theory of Truthmaking -- an analysis, and defense, of the core idea of truthmaker theory, including an argument against truthmaking necessitarianism;
        <li>Properties and their Kind(s) -- a novel defense of the truthmaker argument in favour of properties, and an extension of it to a defense of Aristotelian universals, including an original account of determinables in terms of determination;
        <li>Universals -- a novel account of intrinsicness used in an argument that, fundamentally, there are no relations, while tthere may well be intrinsic structure;
        <li>Exemplification -- a defense of the view that exemplification is a relation, that it explains the unity we observe in the world and that properties are parts of the particulars that exemplify them;
        <li>Generalised adverbialism -- a novel account of adverbial modification and its application to the problem of temporary intrinsics and the philosophy of modality;
        <li>Qua qua qua -- a defense that so-called `qua objects' (`Picasso qua painter') are the referents of adverbially modified noun phrases, ontologically kosher and theoretically very useful.
      </ul>
    <li><b>Introduction &agrave; la logique</b> (375 pages), a comprehensive introductory logic course in French, to be used for a one-year first-year logic course;
      <ul>
        <li>This is the first (!!) comprehensive introduction to logic for philosophers written in French. It differs from Lepage's (1991) introduction and from the available translations of Quine (1971) by covering both natural deduction and tree methods, including correctness and completeness proofs for both propositional and predicate logic, and by paying particular (and non-partisan) attention to philosophical questions. It is ideally suited to be used in an (ambitious) logic course of four hours/semester, as they are being introduced (or, at least should be introduced) in francophone universities.
      </ul>
    <li><b>Ein Dritter Blick auf Descartes' Erste Philosophie</b> (518 pages), an interpretation and defense of the first three Meditations (an extensively expanded version of my MA thesis), in which I argue that
      <ul>
        <li>understanding the distinction between the so-called `analytic' and `synthetic' methods and Descartes' use of it allows us to understand how Descartes can reasonably claim that the doubt of <i>Med.</i> I is universal and the Cogito is indubitable; that universal doubt leaves reasoning intact; that universal doubt includes claims that are performatively indubitable; that it `follows' from our doubting it that we must hold it true that we think; and that the indubitability of our thinking is the `first' principle of Cartesian theism;
        <li>a reconstruction of Descartes' three-step skeptical argument confirms his claim that the doubt so reached is the widest-ranging possible, encompassing in particular second-order knowledge claims that lie at the heart of the Cartesian validation of reason;
        <li>that the Cartesian inference from thinking to existence (which I locate in the third, not the second <i>Meditation</i>) is valid and sound and substantiates Descartes' claim that we are essentially thinking beings.
